# Twitter_Search_Engine

## Code execution

* Step1: Download this github repository.
* Step2: All the python notebooks need files located in the folder data in order to run properly. **Copy and paste all these notebooks in the same directory where the data is.**

## Repository Structure

* In the folder preprocessing_EDA we have the Twitter_Preprocesssing_EDA.ipynb file. In this file we have the code to collect and preprocess the data. Also there is code to create and save the Search Engine structure (index, idf and tf), the training of the Word2Vector and TSNE models and some Exploratory Data Analysis from the data such as WordCloud, Barplot and Correlation Matrix.

* In the folder search-engine we have the Search_Engine.ipynb to execute the different options of the Search Engine.

* In the folder data we have stored all the files needed in order to run the python notebooks such as index, tf, idf, dataframes, Word2Vector model and TSNE output.

* In the folder notebooks we have the code used to answer the questions asked divided in RQ1.ipynb, RQ2.ipynb and RQ3.ipynb.

* In the folder other-outputs there are some files about some execution queries and some screenshots of the Search Engine.

* To facilitate running the Search Engine we have deployed a web app where you can try some queries without running the notebooks! Link: [Twitter Search Engine](https://twittertsearchengine.herokuapp.com/)
